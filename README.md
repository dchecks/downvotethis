## Downvote this

This is a toy to downvote the reddit phenomenon of replying with 'THIS!' when it occurs to a comment on HN.

This shouldn't be used by anyone IRL and I have no idea of how the sophisticated HN algos will respond to it actually being run using a live account.

Obviously, you will need to provide it with an account that has enough community standing to be able to downvote (which you will rightly risk losing if you use this software).
You will also have to set the behaviours to downvote, currently it is set to upvote, as it is easier to test.

Once again and to be perfectly clear, at very best you will be frowned upon for using this, at worst, have your account banned. That responsibility is yours.
